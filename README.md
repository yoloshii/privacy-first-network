## Why Network-Level VPN?

### The Problem with Per-Device VPN Apps

When you install a VPN app like Mullvad, NordVPN, or ProtonVPN on your phone or laptop, you're only protecting **that single device**. This leaves gaps:

| Device | VPN App Support | Risk |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Smart TV | ❌ None | ISP sees all streaming |
| Gaming Console | ❌ None | IP exposed to game servers |
| IoT Devices | ❌ None | Smart home traffic visible |
| Guest Devices | ❌ Can't control | No protection |
| Work Laptop | ⚠️ May conflict | Corporate policy blocks VPN |
| Kids' Devices | ⚠️ Can be disabled | Protection bypassed |

**VPN apps also:**
- Drain battery on mobile devices
- Can be forgotten or disabled
- Require updates on every device
- May leak traffic during app crashes
- Don't protect devices that can't run apps

### The Network-Level Solution

This privacy router sits between your modem and your existing router. **Every device** on your network automatically routes through the VPN — no apps, no configuration, no exceptions.

```

**Every device is protected:** Phones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs, gaming consoles, IoT devices, guests — everything.

## Why Not Just Use Mullvad QUIC or WireGuard Apps?

Great question. Mullvad's QUIC tunnels and WireGuard apps are excellent for individual device protection. Here's when each approach makes sense:

### VPN Apps Are Better When:
- You only need to protect 1-2 devices
- You travel frequently and use different networks
- You want per-app split tunneling
- You're on a network you don't control

### Network-Level VPN Is Better When:
- You have many devices (especially ones that can't run VPN apps)
- You want "set and forget" protection for your entire household
- You need to protect smart home/IoT devices
- You want a **kill switch that actually works** (more on this below)
- You're in a region with VPN blocking/deep packet inspection

### The Kill Switch Problem

Here's something most people don't realize: **VPN app kill switches often fail**.

When a VPN app crashes, loses connection, or during the moments between connection drops and reconnection, your traffic can leak to your ISP. App-based kill switches try to prevent this, but they operate at the application level — if the app itself crashes, the kill switch dies with it.

**This stack implements a hardware-level kill switch:**

```
Normal Operation:
  Device → Privacy Router → VPN Tunnel → Internet ✓

VPN Down (App-based kill switch):
  Device → [App crashed] → ISP sees traffic ✗

VPN Down (This stack):
  Device → Privacy Router → [No route exists] → Traffic blocked ✓
```

The kill switch is implemented in the **firewall and routing table**, not in software. If the VPN tunnel goes down, there is literally no route for traffic to take — it's not blocked by a rule that might fail, it simply has nowhere to go.

---

## Features

### Core Protection
- **Network-wide VPN** — All devices protected automatically
- **Hardware kill switch** — No traffic leaks, ever
- **DNS leak protection** — DNS queries encrypted via DoH
- **IPv6 leak prevention** — IPv6 completely disabled
- **Ad & tracker blocking** — Network-level blocking via AdGuard Home

### Reliability
- **Automatic recovery** — Watchdog restarts tunnel on failure
- **Boot persistence** — VPN starts automatically on power-up
- **Connection monitoring** — Continuous health checks

### Advanced (For Technical Users)
- **DPI bypass** — AmneziaWG obfuscation defeats deep packet inspection
- **Flexible deployment** — Dedicated hardware, VM, or Docker
- **Full observability** — Detailed logging and diagnostics

---

## How the Kill Switch Works

The kill switch is the most important security feature. Here's exactly how it works:

### Firewall Zones

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    FIREWALL ZONES                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐              │
│   │ LAN │───✓────▶│ VPN │         │ WAN │              │
│   └─────┘         └─────┘         └─────┘              │
│      │                               ▲                  │
│      │                               │                  │
│      └───────────✗───────────────────┘                  │
│           (NO FORWARDING ALLOWED)                       │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Traffic from LAN can **only** go to the VPN zone. There is no forwarding rule from LAN to WAN. This isn't a "block" rule that could be bypassed — the route simply doesn't exist.

### Routing Table

```bash
# When VPN is UP:
default dev awg0           # All traffic → VPN tunnel
1.2.3.4 via 192.168.1.1    # VPN server → WAN (exception)

# When VPN is DOWN:
# No default route exists
# Traffic has nowhere to go = blocked
```

### Double Protection

Even if somehow a forwarding rule existed, the routing table provides a second layer: with no default route pointing to WAN, packets would be dropped anyway.

---

## AmneziaWG: Defeating VPN Blocking

Some ISPs and countries use **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** to identify and block VPN traffic. Standard WireGuard has a recognizable packet signature.

**AmneziaWG** is an obfuscated fork of WireGuard that adds:

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Jc | Junk packet count |
| Jmin/Jmax | Junk packet size range |
| S1/S2 | Init packet magic |
| H1-H4 | Header obfuscation |

These parameters make the traffic look like random noise rather than a VPN connection. Your VPN provider supplies these values.

**When do you need this?**
- ISP throttles or blocks VPN traffic
- You're in a country with VPN restrictions
- Corporate networks block WireGuard
- Standard WireGuard connections are unreliable

If your VPN works fine with regular WireGuard, you can use standard WireGuard instead — the architecture works with both.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4/5, x86 mini PC, VM, or any device with 2 NICs
- **VPN Account**: Mullvad, IVPN, ProtonVPN, or any WireGuard-compatible provider
- **Network Access**: Ability to place device between modem and router

### Installation Overview

1. Install OpenWrt on your device
2. Install AmneziaWG (or WireGuard)
3. Configure network interfaces
4. Set up firewall kill switch
5. Deploy AdGuard Home for DNS
6. Install watchdog for auto-recovery
7. Cut over your network

**Detailed instructions:** [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Docker Deployment

For testing or simpler setups:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# Edit .env with your VPN credentials
docker-compose up -d
```

**Note:** Docker deployment requires host networking and has limitations compared to dedicated hardware. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

---

## VPN Provider

This stack was developed, tested, and deployed with **[Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net)**. Mullvad is recommended for privacy-conscious users because they:

- **Keep no customer records** — no logs, no account data
- **Require no personal information** — no email, no username
- **Accept anonymous payment** — cash, cryptocurrency, bank transfer
- **Offer WireGuard natively** — fast, modern protocol

Any provider offering WireGuard configurations works with this stack. For **AmneziaWG obfuscation** (DPI bypass), use the included example parameters or generate your own — Mullvad uses standard WireGuard.

**Mullvad-specific example configs included:**
- `openwrt/amneziawg/mullvad-awg0.conf.example` — Tunnel config with obfuscation
- `adguard/mullvad-AdGuardHome.yaml.example` — DNS using Mullvad DoH
- `docker/mullvad.env.example` — Docker environment for Mullvad

---

## Hardware Recommendations

### Budget (~$50-80)
- Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+) with USB Ethernet adapter
- GL.iNet travel routers (some run OpenWrt)

### Recommended (~$100-150)
- Raspberry Pi 5 with USB 3.0 Ethernet
- Zimaboard or similar x86 SBC

### Performance (~$150-300)
- Mini PC with dual NICs (Intel N100 systems)
- Protectli Vault or similar

### Homelab / Enterprise
- Virtual machine on existing hypervisor (Proxmox, ESXi, Hyper-V)
- Dedicated x86 firewall appliance

---

## Security Considerations

### What This Protects Against
- ISP traffic monitoring and logging
- Network-level ad tracking
- DNS hijacking and monitoring
- IP-based geolocation
- Traffic correlation (when combined with good OpSec)
- VPN blocking via DPI (with AmneziaWG)

### What This Doesn't Protect Against
- Browser fingerprinting
- Logged-in account tracking (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Malware on your devices
- Physical access to your network
- Compromised VPN provider

### OpSec Recommendations
- Use privacy-focused browsers (Firefox, Brave)
- Use privacy-respecting search engines
- Log out of tracking services when not needed
- Consider compartmentalized identities
- Keep devices updated

## AI-Assisted Setup

For complex deployments or troubleshooting, give an AI coding agent access to this **entire repository** plus SSH access to your router.

**Recommended:** This stack was developed, tested, and deployed using **Claude Opus 4.5** via [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). For best results, use a capable frontier model that can execute shell commands and understand network configuration:

- **Claude Opus 4.5 / Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic) — Used for this implementation
- **GPT-5.1** (OpenAI)
- **Gemini 3** (Google)

**What the agent can do:**
- **Network audit** — Probe your current setup and identify requirements
- **Guided configuration** — Generate configs with your specific IPs, keys, and preferences
- **Automated troubleshooting** — Diagnose routing, firewall, and DNS issues in real-time
- **Scripted deployment** — Execute installation steps with your approval

**Quick start:**
1. Clone this repo or give agent GitHub access
2. Point agent to **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — contains the full operational framework
3. Provide SSH credentials to your target device
4. Let agent audit, plan, and guide you through deployment

The agent instructions include diagnostic commands, validation tests, error recovery procedures, and safety rules. All configs in this repo are parameterized and agent-friendly.

## FAQ

**Q: Will this slow down my internet?**
A: Minimal impact. WireGuard is extremely efficient. Most users see <5% speed reduction. The main factor is your VPN provider's server quality.

**Q: Can I still access local network devices?**
A: Yes. LAN traffic stays local and doesn't go through the VPN.

**Q: What if the privacy router fails?**
A: Your network loses internet until it's fixed or bypassed. This is a feature, not a bug — it ensures no unprotected traffic leaks.

**Q: Can I exclude certain devices from the VPN?**
A: Yes, with additional configuration. You can create firewall rules to route specific IPs directly to WAN. See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

**Q: Does this work with IPv6?**
A: IPv6 is disabled to prevent leaks. Most VPN providers don't properly support IPv6 yet.

**Q: Can my ISP see I'm using a VPN?**
A: With standard WireGuard, they can see VPN-like traffic. With AmneziaWG obfuscation, the traffic appears as random noise.
